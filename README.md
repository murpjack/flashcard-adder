# Flashcard maker
This flashcard maker app can be used 
to create a list of simple flashcards, comprising of a `front`, and a `back`, 
and a `title` - as a meaningful identifier.

Once a list - or deck - is ready to be studied, it can be exported as a spreadsheet file, 
which can be imported into a flashcard application, such as Anki.

## Features
* Create a single card with text fields.
* Save any changes to a card that is in progress, when the `save as draft` button is pressed. 
* View list of created cards.
* All cards visible in list can be edited.
* All cards visible in list may be deleted.
* List of cards is saved in browser localstorage after completing a card.
* List of cards is restored from localstorage, where a list has been saved.
* A List may be exported as a '.csv' file
